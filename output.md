The planning fallacy, a cognitive bias leading to underestimation of task completion time, costs, and risks, significantly impacts MLOps cost overruns [3], [6]. This report synthesizes research on the planning fallacy, its manifestations, and potential mitigation strategies within the context of MLOps.

### Problematization

MLOps, the discipline of streamlining the machine learning lifecycle, is particularly vulnerable to the planning fallacy due to its inherent complexity and reliance on predictive modeling [1], [2]. Cost overruns in MLOps projects can have severe consequences, diverting resources from other critical areas and potentially leading to project failure [4]. Traditional planning approaches often focus on best-case scenarios, neglecting the high probability of unforeseen problems [1]. This optimism bias, where individuals believe they are less likely to experience negative outcomes, exacerbates the planning fallacy [5].

### Critical Source Engagement

Several sources highlight the pervasive nature of the planning fallacy across diverse domains, from construction to IT projects [4], [5], [6]. Studies have shown that a significant percentage of major projects exceed their initial budgets, with average cost overruns reaching substantial figures [1], [4]. While the planning fallacy has been identified as a key contributor to cost overruns, some researchers question its sole explanatory power, suggesting a need for broader theoretical frameworks [11].

The "inside view," focusing on specific project details and envisioned steps, often overshadows the "outside view," which incorporates statistical data from similar past projects [3]. This neglect of base rates and historical data contributes to unrealistic optimism and inaccurate forecasting [3], [6]. Furthermore, cognitive and motivational factors, such as self-enhancement and commitment to optimistic goals, can further distort probabilistic reasoning [3].

### Layered, Escalating Analysis

1.  **Cognitive Bias and MLOps:** The planning fallacy is a cognitive bias that impairs critical thinking and decision-making [2], [17]. In MLOps, this can manifest as underestimating the time required for data preparation, model training, deployment, and monitoring. Overconfident and unrealistic plans lead to poor strategic decisions, impacting the overall success of MLOps projects [2]. The complexity of MLOps, involving various stages and stakeholders, amplifies the effects of the planning fallacy [6].

2.  **Resource Allocation and the Planning Fallacy:** Effective resource allocation is crucial for MLOps success [16], [19], [20]. However, the planning fallacy can lead to misallocation of resources, as projects are initially underfunded or understaffed due to inaccurate cost estimations [15], [21]. This can result in delays, compromised quality, and ultimately, cost overruns [9], [12]. Cognitive biases and sponsorship bias can further influence resource allocation decisions, leading to suboptimal outcomes [21].

3.  **Mitigation Strategies:** Several strategies can help mitigate the planning fallacy in MLOps. Reference class forecasting, which anchors estimates to empirical distributions of comparable outcomes, has proven effective in reducing bias [3], [6]. Scenario planning, using techniques like morphological analysis, can help evaluate alternatives and develop contingency plans [14]. Building Information Modeling (BIM) can improve cost estimation accuracy in construction projects, suggesting potential applications in MLOps for infrastructure and resource planning [7]. Feature selection and machine learning techniques can also enhance software cost estimation, providing more accurate predictions for MLOps projects [8], [10].

4.  **Organizational Factors:** Organizational support plays a moderating role in project success, helping to mitigate the negative impacts of cost overruns and delays [12]. Clear communication, collaboration, and a culture of realistic planning are essential for overcoming the planning fallacy in MLOps [1], [4]. The design of resource allocation tools can also influence fairness and accuracy in decision-making, potentially curbing biases that lead to inequitable outcomes [15].

### Contradictions, Gaps, Novel Trajectories

While the planning fallacy is widely recognized as a significant contributor to cost overruns, some research suggests that it may not be the sole explanation [11]. Further investigation is needed to explore other factors, such as political influences, organizational culture, and external market conditions, that may also contribute to inaccurate cost estimations in MLOps. There is a gap in the literature regarding specific mitigation strategies tailored to the unique challenges of MLOps. Future research should focus on developing and evaluating interventions that address the planning fallacy in the context of machine learning projects.

### Conclusions and Implications

The planning fallacy poses a significant threat to MLOps projects, leading to cost overruns, delays, and compromised quality. By understanding the cognitive biases and organizational factors that contribute to the planning fallacy, MLOps teams can implement strategies to mitigate its impact. Reference class forecasting, scenario planning, and improved resource allocation tools can help to create more realistic plans and budgets. Furthermore, fostering a culture of realistic planning and providing adequate organizational support are essential for MLOps success.

### Future Inquiry Suggestions

Future research should investigate the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies in the context of MLOps. Studies could examine the impact of reference class forecasting, scenario planning, and machine learning-based cost estimation techniques on MLOps project outcomes. Additionally, research should explore the role of organizational culture and leadership in promoting realistic planning and mitigating the planning fallacy in MLOps. Finally, the development of specific tools and frameworks for MLOps cost estimation, tailored to the unique challenges of machine learning projects, would be a valuable contribution to the field.
